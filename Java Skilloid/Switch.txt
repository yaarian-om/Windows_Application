It is a list type thing. you can choose an option by pressing 1 or 2 or a or b.

Syntax:
int n;
switch(n){
    case 1:{
      break; //  Break is needed to stop it and not to run further
    }
    case 2 :{
      break;
    }
}

Type-2 :
switch that takes Characters as input to run accordingly
Syntax:
char variable;
switch(variable){
    case 'a':{
      break; //  Break is needed to stop it and not to run further
    }
