Loop is used to do a same work again and again. And it helps us to code faster.
It also improves the reusiblity.
There are 4 types of loops
of them,

1. For Loop :
The Java for loop is a control flow statement that iterates a part of the programs multiple times.
If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
Syntax :
for(init;condition;incr/decr){  
// code to be executed 
}
Syntax of infinity loop :
for(;;){  
//code to be executed  
}

2. For-Each Loop :
For each loop is the upgraded version of for loop, It is mostly used
with array.
Syntax :
for dataType variable: arrayName) {
    // your Code
    //System.out.println(variable);
}

3. While loop :
The Java while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of the 
programs repeatedly on the basis of given boolean condition.
If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.
Syntax :
variable;
while(condition){  
//code to be executed
increment/decrement;
}

4. Do-While Loop :
The Java do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of the 
programs at least once and the further execution depends upon the given boolean condition.
If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once,
it is recommended to use the do-while loop.
Syntax :
variable;
do{  
//code to be executed 
increment/decrement; 
}while(condition);
