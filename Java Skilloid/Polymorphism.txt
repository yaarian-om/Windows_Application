Polymorphism:
The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability 
of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
1.Compile time Polymorphism
2.Runtime Polymorphism

Example of Polymorphism:
1.Method Overloading.
2.Method Overriding.
3.Constructor Overloading.
4.Polymorphic Behavior of Objects.

Method Overloading:
1.Methods MUST be in same class.
2.Method Name MUST be same.
3.Method Parameter MUST be different.
4.Method Return Type may or may not be same.

Method Overriding:
Methods MUST be in two different classes.
1.There MUST be inheritance between the two classes.
2.Method Name MUST be same.
3.Method Parameter MUST be same.
4.Method Return Type MUST be same.
