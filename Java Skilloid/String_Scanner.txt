String:
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. 
In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.
The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings. 
The String class has many methods. The most used are:
length() - returns the number of characters in the String.
charAt() - returns the character at the specified index.
equals() - returns true if two strings have equal contents.

Greater than zero - if the invoking String is "greater than" the other.
indexOf() - returns the index of specified String or character.
substring() -returns a portion of the String's text.
toUpperCase(), toLowerCase() - converts the String to upper- or lower-case characters.
