File io:
The File class from the java.io package, allows us to work with files.
To use the File class, create an object of the class, and specify the filename or directory name:
import java.io.File;  // Import the File class
File myObj = new File("filename.txt"); // Specify the filename

#Methods of File Class;
canRead(),canWrite(),createNewFile(),delete(),exists(),getName(),
getAbsolutePath(),length(),list(),mkdir().

#Creating file:
To create a file in Java, you can use the createNewFile() method. 
This method returns a boolean value: true if the file was successfully created, 
and false if the file already exists. 
The method is enclosed in a try...catch block. 
This is necessary because it throws an IOException if an error occurs 
(if the file cannot be created for some reason).
File myObj = newFile("C:\\Users\\MyName\\filename.txt");

#Writing in File:
We use the FileWriter class together with its write() 
method to write some text to the file we created. 
Note that when you are done writing to the file, 
you should close it with the close() method.

#Reading from File:
We create object of FileReader class to read some text from a file we created. 
We create BufferedReader object using the FileReader class object to read the file content.
Note that when you are done reading to the file, you should close it with the close() method
