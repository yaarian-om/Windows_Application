Class & Object:

Object- Objects have states and behaviors. 
Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as 
behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
There are three steps when creating an object from a class −
Declaration − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.
Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.
Initialization − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.

Class− A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
