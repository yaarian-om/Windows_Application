Data Type:
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
There are two types of data types in Java:

1.Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2.Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

Type Casting:
Type Casting is the process of converting  the value of a primitive data type to another primitive data type. 
There are two types of types Casting in Java:

1.Implicit Type Casting.
2.Explicit Type Casting:Converting the value of a larger primitive data type to a smaller primitive data type.
Possibility of value loss during the conversion exists.
